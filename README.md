# Riverdale Clicky Game

#### Test your memory with the cast of *Riverdale*.

####  This application render different images of Riverdale cast memeberrs. Each image listens for click events. Each time a user clicks on an image the tiles shuffle into a new order. Click on each character *once* to win the game. But don't click on a character twice, or it's game over for you!

#### The Riverdale Clicky Game keeps track of the user's score. If the user clicks the same image more than once their score is reset to zero.

#### Built with React. Check it out [here](https://kbefff.github.io/memory-game/).
